# HumanLayer Resources and Codebase

## About HumanLayer

HumanLayer (YC W24) builds CodeLayer, an agentic IDE that helps teams manage AI coding agents. Their methodology is battle-tested on complex codebases and is the source of the "Context Engineering" term coined in April 2025.

**Mission:** Help teams transition to 99% AI-written code without sacrificing quality.

**Philosophy:** "No vibes allowed" - AI agent-enabled coding is a deeply technical engineering craft.
